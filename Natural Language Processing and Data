Natural Language Processing and Data

Where do you start?
1. Identify your dataset
2. Identify the tools you will need
3. Decide whether your report will be automated or ad hoc
	The timing of your reports matter - daily reports won't actually give you a lot of value
	You want to match your sprint cadence

A little bit of python and SQL can make you a bit of a human powerhouse

Mehodology used in Text Mining
Catergrization of features:
- Cluster analysis
Sentiment analysisit
Time series analysis - you can identify changes over time, matching against releases or other changes
Lexical dispersion - maintains the word order, so you can see how the use of words change over time, as well. How many times did you see "difficult" "won't let me" over time?

Infomratin Retrieval:
Bag of words - top 25 or so words, finding the comments that use those words -  can point you to the right, most common type of comment/feeback to read and study
Search functionality

Unsupervised machine learning - throw it at the computer ansd see what they make of it
Hierarchical clustering
K-means clustering
- Sci-kit and NLTK offer easy to use modules for K-means clustering
Maximum Entropy (sometimes classified ad supervised)


Supervised Machine Learning
A classifer is supervised if it's built on training corpora
Naive Bayes Classifiers
- a probablistic classifier
Decision Trees
 ... 

 Machine learning sentiment analysis is considered good if it's 60-65% (sometimes up to 70%) accurate to human eyes. There's room for growth there!

 Security + improved sentiment analysis + facial recognition ... there's some awesome work still to be done here.

 There's lots of room to work on it - you'll be here.

 Lexicons sometimes require human input to rate or score the dictionary -- or you can do it automatically using seed words to expand a list of words
