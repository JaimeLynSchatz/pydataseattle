Devour this!!

functions
avoiding side effects
first class fucntions
laziness
immitability

xs = [1, 2, 3]
it = iter(xs)
 next(it) # will give you 1
 next(it) # will give you 2

Just throws you out when you don't have a next to grad

def lazy_intergers(n=0):
while True:
yield n
n+= 1

xs = lazy_integers()

##itertools
from itertools import count
count([start=0], [step=1])
islice(seq, [start=0], stop, [step=1])
 from itertools import tee
 tee(it, [n=2])
