#Swarm Intelligence Optimization Using Python
James McCaffrey - Microsoft Research, Advanced Development

##Classical Numberical Optimization
- has issues with where errors can sneak in
##Amoeba Method Optimization
- worst - btest - other
Take three potential solutions
Abandon the worst, then try again, following the average between the best and the other
"Simplex optimization", sometimes called Nelder-Mead algorithm
It's not really an algorithm, but a heuristic
Best and worst are caluculated based on the Euclidean distance
simplex: has three points, it's a triangle (more or less)
You're measuring the error based on the training data

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method

Faults: Local optima (well, all of them)
This one just doesn't work sometimes. It depends heavily on initialization (where the points start from)


##Particlce Swarm Optimization
This became a hint for swarm optimization

Start with trying to solve the sphere function - everything can solve it. If yours can't, the algorithm has a problem!!

Velocity - where will the partileend up next in the next iteration

learning rate, momentum in neural networks - they're constants that when you tune them, can make your algorithm blow up.
The wieghts or conttancts in the particle swarm optimixation is a little less sensitive to changes in those weights.

Rastrigin's Function
Another benchmark function

A common technicque is to have particles die off if they're getting stuck or are low performers, then you give birth to new ones at a new location. 

##Simlated Bee Colony Optimixation
Combinatorical optimzation rahter than numberical optimixation
Eac bee has a path and an associated error
scouts randomly search

The standard benchmark problem is the travelling salesman problem. Goal - visit each city in the shortest distance possible


Genetic Algorithms - numerical
Ant Colony Optimization - cominatorial models ant foraging, graph path problems only
Baterial Foraging Optimization - numberical, models several behaviors of bacterium
Firefly Algorithm Optimization - numberical, models firlesly bioluminiscence and motion, multi-modal
Simiilated Annealing - combinatorial models cooling metal - not a swarm technique

Takeaway - if normal (calculous or matricies aren't feasible), then use swarm methonds.

Swarm solutions take a lo to fo processing power.

It's an interesting thing - swarm intelliegence optimization typically can't be proven with formal mathematical proofs, BUT
