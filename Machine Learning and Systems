#Machine Learning and Systems

Mature systems as 5% machine learning code, 95% is glue code (from google article below)

Inside Out: algorithms, software, hardware, layer of hardware around the hardware, project staff, consumers (someone wants the info/data/learning/intelligence), organizaiton and society: there's societal impact on whatever you're doing with ML.


Each level of abstraction is hurt by the decisions made at the layer below it.

What's the essence of what I care about?
What's the question - not just what's the most perfect algorithm.

False positives vs. missed detection is very different when talking about inter-cranial pressure in the ermgency ward and drone targeting. One, you can't have any missed detections and the latter, you don't want any false positives.

Build DS workflow on test set, like the offline testing accuacy
then deploy and start monotiring results
then online accuracy is worse than expected
What to do:
1. band head to find overfitting in model
2. retrain - more data means better model
3. Doncept drift: if retraining doen't help, jigger the DS workflow
4. Or may ... prediciton influenced outcome (hold our some live -- think about the STripe talk - if you dn't let what you think are fraudulent transactions through then your data is going to look different.)

AA testing and AB testing is relevent t this, too

Engarde Hypothesis, Feature Forge testing tools
Is the data changinging? Is that effecting the outcomes due to chnages

Model deployement testing: alert a human if things are too different than before. AND use automated tools to try to isolate cuase of chnage - data or code???

Fault Tolerant ML
augmentation vs. full automation

Build an ML system only becuase you have to - not (just) because it's fun.
###End user fault tolerance is  MUST
